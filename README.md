Diwali Sales Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes Diwali sales data to uncover key trends and customer purchasing behavior. The analysis uses countplot to visualize normal order distributions and bar plots to compare orders with their corresponding amounts across different categories. The insights aim to help businesses optimize their sales strategies during festive seasons.

# Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
1. Pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation
2. NumPy: Numerical computations
3. Seaborn: Data visualization (Countplot, Bar plot)
4. Matplotlib: Plotting graphs
Jupyter Notebook: Development environment

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information on customer demographics, product categories, and sales data during Diwali.

# Steps in Analysis
1. Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and outliers.
Standardized data formats.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed demographics and purchasing behaviors.
Visualized key trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3. Key Insights:
Derived actionable insights on customer preferences.

4. Data Export:
Cleaned and processed data exported to Excel for further use.

# Visualizations
Countplot: Shows the distribution of normal orders.
Bar Plot: Compares orders and amounts across different product categories.
